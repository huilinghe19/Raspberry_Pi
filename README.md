# Aim
Writing a Epics Server to connect GPIB Devices on Raspberry Platform 

# Raspberry_Pi
Raspberry Pi is a small functional linux computer. We would like to use it for the extra implementation for the experiment control due to its small size and functional property. On the Raspberry Pi we can get the GPIB Interface for the devices. Now our aim is to connect the Raspberry Pi with Epics for GPIB Devices Control.


# Epics Server for GPIB Device
1. Epics Base works on Raspberry Pi. (using JÃ¶rdis Dokumentation)

2. Test how GPIB works. It does not work. No package gpib_ctypes is installed.

      Install gpib_ctypes at first.
