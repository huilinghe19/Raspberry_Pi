# Aim
Writing a Epics Server to connect GPIB Devices on Raspberry Platform 

# Raspberry_Pi
Raspberry Pi is a small functional linux computer. We would like to use it for the extra implementation for the experiment control due to its small size and functional property. On the Raspberry Pi we can get the GPIB Interface for the devices(to be proved!!!). Now our aim is to connect the Raspberry Pi with Epics IOC for GPIB Device Control.


# Epics Server 
1. Epics Base works on Raspberry Pi (using JÃ¶rdis's Dokumentation).

2. To do: 

   Read Epics Streamdevice and Asyn documentation and find how they work. 
   
# GPIB Device support
1. Test how GPIB works. It does not work with Keithley 2000. When I use Python to test the GPIB function, "No package gpib_ctypes is installed. ". The old patch version of linux-gpib-4.1.0 for raspi-gpib_driver is no longer there. So I decide to install the 4.2.0 Version. Information link: https://github.com/elektronomikon/raspi_gpib_driver

      Install linux-gpib and raspi_gpib_driver. 

      
       cd ~/Downloads
       mkdir HHL
       git clone https://github.com/elektronomikon/raspi_gpib_driver.git


       tar xzf linux-gpib-kernel-4.2.0.tar.gz
       cd linux-gpib-kernel-4.2.0
       ./configure
       
2. After installing linux-gpib and raspi patch packages(make install has been done). There is something wrong in GPIB configuration file. GPIB has not been installed in Raspberry. What is the address of the GPIB device? 
       
       >>> ibterm -b19
       >>> Error
       >>> sudo nano gpib.config
       >>> ??????
